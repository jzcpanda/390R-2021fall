    "# Introduction\n",
    "In general the data science process is iterative and the different components blend together. For  simplicity we discretize the tasks into the following 7 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define the question you want to ask the data  \n",
    "2. Get the data  \n",
    "3. Clean the data  \n",
    "4. Explore the data  \n",
    "5. Fit statistical models  \n",
    "6. Communicate the results  \n",
    "7. Make your analysis reproducible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of data science questions.\n",
    "There are four classes of questions that we will focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive: The goal of descriptive data science questions is to understand the components of a dataset, describe what they are, and explain that description to others who might want to understand the data. This is the simplest type of data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory: The goal of exploratory data science questions is to find unknown relationships between the different variables you have measured in your dataset. Exploratory analysis is open ended and designed to find expected or unexpected relationships between different measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential: The goal of inferential data science questions is to is to use a small sample of data to say something about what would happen if we collected more data. Inferential questions come up because we want to understand the relationships between different variables but it is too expensive or difficult to collect data on every person or object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive: The goal of predictive data science question is to predict values for new individuals. This might be predicting what will happen in the future or predicting characteristics that are difficult to measure. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/EDA/typeofanalysis.jpg\" alt=\"ds\" style=\"width: 750px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Loosely speaking, any method of looking at data that does not include formal statistical modeling and inference falls under the term exploratory data analysis，or EDA for short. In this topic, we will consider descriptive analysis as well since it is usually a step before EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is an iterative cycle. You need to\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Generate questions about your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modelling your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA is not a formal process with a strict set of rules; it is a state of mind. During the initial phases of EDA you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you. Some of these ideas will pan out, and some will be dead ends. As your exploration continues, you will focus on a few particularly productive areas that you will eventually write up and communicate to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- EDA is an important part of any data analysis, even if the questions are handed to you on a platter, because you always need to investigate the quality of your data. Data cleaning is just one application of EDA: you ask questions about whether your data meet your expectations or not. To do data cleaning, you need to deploy all the tools of EDA: visualisation, transformation, and modelling. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, transformations, or models to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to ask revealing questions at the start of your analysis because you do not know what insights are contained in your dataset. On the other hand, each new question that you ask will expose you to a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery. You can quickly drill down into the most interesting parts of your data and develop a set of thought-provoking questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.What type of variation occurs within my variables? \n",
    "\n",
    "2.What type of covariation occurs between my variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type question is related to univariate EDA, and the second is related to multivariate (usually just bivariate) EDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Univariate EDA\n",
    "\n",
    " <!-- This is true even if you measure quantities that are constant, like the speed of light. Each of your measurements will include a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement. Categorical variables can also vary if you measure across different subjects (e.g. the eye colors of different people), or different times (e.g. the energy levels of an electron at different moments). Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal interesting information.  -->\n",
    "\n",

    "### Shape\n",
    "Determining the shape of your variable is essential before any further analysis is done. Statistical methods used for inference often require your data to be distributed in a certain manner before they can be applied to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal distribution**  (also referred to as the Gaussian distribution) is a very common distribution and is often described as a bell-shaped curve. In this distribution, the values are symmetric around the central value with a high density of the values falling right around the central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/visualization/normal.jpg\" alt=\"ds\" style=\"width: 750px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable can be described as normally distributed if:   \n",
    "\n",
    "* There is a strong tendency for data to take a central value --- many of the observations are centered around the middle of the range.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Deviations away from the central value are equally likely in both directions --- the frequency of these deviations away form the central value occurs at the same rate on either side of the central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skewed distribution**:  most of the values fall to one end of the range, leaving a tail off to the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/visualization/skew.jpg\" alt=\"ds\" style=\"width: 750px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uniform distribution**: values for a variable are equally likely to be found along any portion of the distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Central tendency\n",
    "The two most commonly used measures of central tendency are: mean and median. \n",
    "The mean (often referred to as the average) is equal to the sum of all the observations in the variable divided by the total number of observations in the variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the middle observation for a variable after the observations in that variable have been arranged in order of magnitude (from smallest to largest). The median is the middle value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variation\n",
    "In addition to measures of central tendency, measures of variability are key in describing the values within a variable.  Common and helpful measures of variability are: standard deviation, variance, and interquartile range. These are measures of how spread out the values in a variable are.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance tells you how spread out the values are. If all the values within your variable are exactly the same, that variable’s variance will be zero. The larger your variance, the more spread out your values are.  The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. The interquartile range is the difference between the third and the first quartiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outliers\n",
    "Outliers are observations that are unusual. Sometimes outliers are data entry errors; other times outliers suggest important new science. When you have a lot of data, outliers are sometimes difficult to see in a histogram. For example, take the distribution of the `y` variable from the `diamonds` dataset. The only evidence of outliers is the unusually wide limits on the x-axis.\n",
