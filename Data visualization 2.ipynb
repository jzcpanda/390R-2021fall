However, the whiskers don’t always extend to the smallest and largest observed values. They in fact extend no more than  $1.5\\times$ the interquartile range from either end of the box. In this case, no more than $1.5 \\times 9 =13.5$ from either end of the box. Any observed values outside this range get marked with points called outliers.
